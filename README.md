It seems like you're referring to "Photopia," which is a text-based interactive fiction game created by Adam Cadre. The game is known for its innovative narrative structure and emotional depth. However, there is no specific role or title called "Photopia Director" associated with the game.

If you are referring to a director in the context of a film or theater adaptation of "Photopia," there is no widely known adaptation of the game into another medium as of my last update in October 2023. If you have a specific context or question in mind, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist!
